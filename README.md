# Customer International Payments Portal

## Overview
A secure customer portal for creating and tracking international transfers while allowing authorized bank staff to verify and forward those transactions to **SWIFT**. The app enforces password hashing and salting, strict input validation, HTTPS, CSRF protection, security headers, and rate limiting.

It includes two main interfaces:
- **Customer Portal:** for registration, login, and payment initiation.
- **Staff Portal:** for employee login and SWIFT verification (no registration required).

---

## Staff Portal Functionality
Employees of the bank are **pre-registered** and log in using credentials created by the admin.  
They can:
- View pending customer transactions  
- Check payee account details and SWIFT codes  
- Verify SWIFT accuracy using RegEx whitelisting  
- Click **‚ÄúVerify‚Äù** for each valid transaction  
- Click **‚ÄúSubmit to SWIFT‚Äù** to complete the payment process  

Once a staff member submits to SWIFT, the transaction is marked complete.

## Security Implementation
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **No Staff Registration** | Only admins can create employee accounts. |
| **Password Security** | All passwords are hashed and salted using **argon2id**. |
| **RegEx Input Whitelisting** | Ensures only safe input patterns are accepted for account and SWIFT fields. |
| **Transport Security (SSL/TLS)** | HTTPS enforced with HSTS headers for secure data transmission. |
| **Helmet Headers** | Protects against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing). |
| **CORS Policy** | API access limited to the official frontend. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Prevents brute-force attacks during login. |
| **JWT Authentication** | Short-lived access tokens and secure refresh cookies. |
| **Error Handling** | Sanitized responses prevent data leakage. |
| **Upload Validation** | File uploads restricted by MIME type and size. |

## Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | React (Vite) |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express |
| **Database** | MongoDB |
| **Auth** | JWT + argon2id |
| **Security Middleware** | Helmet, CORS, HSTS, Regex filters |
| **DevOps & CI/CD** | GitHub + CircleCI + SonarCloud |
| **Testing Tools** | npm audit, OWASP ZAP, SonarCloud Scanner |

## Continuous Integration & Testing

The repository includes an automated **CircleCI** pipeline that performs:

| Type | Tool | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|
| **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** | SonarCloud | Checks for vulnerabilities, code smells, and hotspots |
| **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)** | npm audit | Detects known vulnerabilities in dependencies |
| **Dynamic/API Testing (DAST)** | OWASP ZAP | Tests API endpoints for runtime vulnerabilities |

---

## SonarCloud Setup
In your CircleCI ‚Üí **Contexts ‚Üí SonarCloud**, add the following environment variables:

| Variable | Value |
|-----------|--------|
| `SONAR_TOKEN` | Your SonarCloud token |
| `SONAR_HOST_URL` | `https://sonarcloud.io` |
| `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` | `herkeens_test` |
| `SONAR_ORG` | `herkeens` |
